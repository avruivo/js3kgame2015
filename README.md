[Js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. The competition starts at 13:00 CEST, every 13th of August and ends at 13:00 CEST, every 13th of September. The theme for 2015 was **“Reversed”.**

Unfortunately, I did have the free time to finish the game on time for the contest, but here is the source code anyway.
