[Js13kGames](http://js13kgames.com) is a JavaScript coding competition for HTML5 Game Developers. The fun part of the compo is the file size limit set to 13 kilobytes. The competition starts at 13:00 CEST, every 13th of August and ends at 13:00 CEST, every 13th of September. The theme for 2015 was **“Reversed”.**

Unfortunately, I did not have the free time to finish the game before the contest's deadline, but here is the source code anyway.

In my last commit I was finishing some bug fixes on the **Black Square** artificial intelligence (AI). You can take a peek on how things were looking:

**Red Squares** represent every Bot the human player would be able to pick, choosing only one at a time but being able to switch between all of the **Red Squares** to try and capture the **Black Square**.
